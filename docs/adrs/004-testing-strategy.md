# ADR 004: Testing Strategy with pytest and hypothesis

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a comprehensive testing strategy that covers:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for agent interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Property-based testing for data validation logic

## Decision
We will use:
- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **hypothesis**: Property-based testing for robust validation
- **pytest-asyncio**: Testing async FastAPI endpoints
- **pytest-cov**: Code coverage reporting
- **TestClient**: FastAPI's built-in test client

Test organization:
```
/tests/unit/      - Unit tests for individual components
/tests/integration/ - Tests for agent interactions
/tests/e2e/        - End-to-end workflow tests
```

## Rationale
- **pytest**: Industry standard, excellent plugin ecosystem
- **hypothesis**: Finds edge cases through property-based testing
- **pytest-asyncio**: Native support for async/await patterns
- **Coverage tracking**: Ensures code quality through metrics
- **Fast feedback**: Unit tests run quickly in CI/CD

## Consequences
- Need to maintain test fixtures and mock data
- Property-based tests can be slower than example-based tests
- Requires discipline to maintain good test coverage
- Integration tests may need database setup/teardown

## Alternatives Considered
- **unittest**: Python's built-in testing framework
  - Rejected: More verbose, less feature-rich than pytest
- **Behave**: BDD framework
  - Rejected: Adds unnecessary complexity for this project
